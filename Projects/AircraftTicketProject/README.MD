<h1>Air ticket sales system project<h1>

By the end of the courses from BITLAB academy, I have completed my first big project in Java. This project is a simple imitation of the air ticket sales system. There are the following functions here:

1.  Admin panel with the ability to:
    1.  Create planes, cities and flights
    2.  Change planes, cities and flights
    3.  Remove planes, cities and flights
2.  Cashier panel with the ability to:
    1.  Create tickets
    2.  Change tickets data
    3.  Remove tickets
